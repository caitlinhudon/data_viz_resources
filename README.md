# data_viz_resources
Collected resources related to data visualization

## Getting started with creating your own data visualizations
* [Data Viz Project](https://datavizproject.com/) is a great resource for learning about different kinds of charts, including use cases and pretty examples
* For R users (or folk who want to learn a first language for data viz), I can't recommend the R package [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) (and the many related packages in the ggplot ecosystem!) enough for building your own visualizations
* For Python users, the data viz landscape is more varied and hasn't converged on a single package. Check out [this article](https://medium.com/codex/beyond-matplotlib-and-seaborn-python-data-visualization-tools-that-work-3ef7f8d1500e) by [Stephanie Kirmer](https://twitter.com/data_stephanie) for a survey of Python data viz packages.
* If you use Excel, there are some neat tutorials on building charts [here](https://simplexct.com/charts-in-excel) and [here](https://policyviz.com/category/tutorials/)
* Check out [#TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TidyTuesday), a community centered around creating data visualizations based on [a new dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) each week

## Good reads on the fundamentals
* [The Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) by Claus Wilke (available free online); if you read only one book on how to do data visualization, this is the one I'd recommend 
* [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and/or [Visual Explanations](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_visex) by Edward Tufte
